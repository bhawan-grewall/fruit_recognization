## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of identifying fruit types using image classification techniques. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of fruit images and can classify images into several fruit categories. It can be used in applications such as automated checkout systems, fruit sorting in agriculture, or mobile apps for fruit identification.

## Features

- Image classification of fruits using deep learning
- Preprocessing and augmentation of image data
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Model inference for new/unseen fruit images
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhawan-grewall/fruit_recognization.git
   cd fruit_recognization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

3. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**
   - Download or prepare your fruit images and organize them into `data/train` and `data/test` folders by class.
   - Alternatively, use the sample dataset provided in the repository (if available).

2. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path ./models/latest_model.pth
   ```

4. **Predict on new images:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```

   The script will output the predicted fruit class.

## Dataset

- The project expects the dataset to be organized as follows:
  ```
  data/
    train/
      apple/
      banana/
      orange/
      ...
    test/
      apple/
      banana/
      orange/
      ...
  ```
- Each subfolder should contain images of the corresponding fruit.

## Model Architecture

- The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, utilizing popular frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow (check implementation).
- Includes options for transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet).
